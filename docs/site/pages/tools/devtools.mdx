# Devtools

Our Devtools player extension has been redesigned to work with manifest v3. It leverages plugins to handle communicated between the inspected Player-UI instance and the devtools extension panel. 

## Devtools architecture
The devtools extension is running an instance of Player. By running an instance of Player in the devtools extension; we are able to leverage the Player plugin system. The plugin author can select which hooks to tap in, what information to gather, and how to interact with it.

The two instances of Player-UI [The extension and the inspected instance] are communicating through a Messenger class. This messenger class acts as a communication layer this is agnostic, self-sufficient, and a loss-less messenger designed for seamless communication between instances.
It operates indepdently without a bookkeeper ensuring no data loss during communication.


## Devtools basic plugin
We provide a basic dev tools plugin that displays information about the inspected Player-ui Instance. It provides plugin information, flow, logs, and exposes a console for expression evaluation.

## Devtools assets
https://github.com/player-ui/devtools-assets, devtools UI is our collection of asset packages and assets that's designed to be leveraged with our devtools basic plugin.
