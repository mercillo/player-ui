# Devtools

## Introduction
https://github.com/player-ui/browser-devtools 
Our Devtools player extension has been redesigned to work with manifest v3. It leverages plugins to handle communicated between the inspected Player-UI instance and the devtools extension panel. 

## Devtools architecture
The devtools extension is running an instance of Player. By running an instance of Player in the devtools extension; we are able to leverage the Player plugin system. The plugin author can select which hooks to tap in, what information to gather, and how to interact with it.

The two instances of Player-UI [The extension and the inspected instance] are communicating through a Messenger class injected into the content script. This messenger class acts as a communication layer this is agnostic, self-sufficient, and a loss-less messenger designed for seamless communication between instances.
It operates indepdently without a bookkeeper ensuring no data loss during communication.

Read more about the Devtools Messenger here https://github.com/player-ui/tools/blob/3ca98bdc70c76e290084b75c5b8f26ebb35b0dd0/devtools/messenger/README.md

The `devtools-client` is used in our browser-extension https://github.com/player-ui/browser-devtools. This is where you can create custom devtool panels that can be used to debug and inspect your Player-UI Experiences.


## Devtools basic plugin
We provide a basic dev tools plugin that displays information about the inspected Player-ui Instance. [devtools/plugins/desktop/basic]. This is essentially a player plugin that provides plugin information, flow, logs, and exposes a console for expression evaluation. It uses our devtools-assets 
to render the UI.

As of the current state; the basic plugin will help debug flows, data, and views within player. In the future; we hope to release plugins that will also help with content authoring.

## Devtools assets
https://github.com/player-ui/devtools-assets, devtools UI is our collection of asset packages and assets that's designed to be leveraged with our devtools basic plugin.


## Usage
To use the extension, you need to have the Player UI Devtools running in the inspected page leveraging one or more devtools plugins and have the extension installed. For more information on how to install and use the Player UI Devtools, check out the Player UI Devtools documentation.


## How to write your own devtools plugins
You may create your own plugins and test them by adding them into the ReactPlayerOptions as plugins. Check out our Player UI Devtools Plugin template thats coming soon.

```
const testingPlugins: ReactPlayerOptions["plugins"] = [
  new BasicWevDevtoolsPlugin() as unknown as ReactPlayerPlugin,
];

const config: ReactPlayerOptions = {
  plugins: [
    new ReferenceAssetsPlugin() as unknown as ReactPlayerPlugin,
    ...testingPlugins,
  ],
};
```
