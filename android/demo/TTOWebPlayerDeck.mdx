title: Owning your destiny with TTO Web Player
---


# Current State && Pain Points
-CGPlayerPlugin is really a TurboTaxPlayerPlugin
	-tax types, expressions, etc
	-legacy plugins
-tto-web-player is general purpose TurboTax Player integration
	-where is mobile? who owns it?
	-what about desktop? (currently use the webplayerplugin)

	
-What external actions are supported by TurboTax

## Any other pain points?
  We support all of this legacy stuff; but is there a way to not support this?
  Not really a way to remove legacy support due to previous tax years that we support.
  no good path for reducing this tech debt.
  Not an option to not support it.
  
  Future pain point (early p3) Turbotax web plugin; very catered to running in the turbo tax application. IEP uses it. The root integration are not the same. (beaconing, very exclusive areas that are running in areas)

  Error remediation uses our assets; is it our responsibility?

  Visibility on errors down stream services and plugins. 

  ease of onboarding other people; where does a team contribute a plugin for a feature.
  TTO web player is the best location; but is it really the best location?
  how do they integrate those points more easily and how do we get awareness when things blow up.

  How is this reflected in mobile and desktop?
    -Nothing in mobile platform; 
  
  Having the web stuff managed by us; but its hard to get it supported by mobile. hard to get them to prioitize.
  There was a crash that happened on native because they didnt test for it. They only tested on Web.

  TTMobile had no plans to consume; no parity.
  Numerous issues with updating dependencies; and that caused issues with TTM. causing crashes and UI bugs.

  Integration with ios and android is NOT the same. Finding where to make the change for both is not consitent. 


# Use Cases
  - Think about current state vs target state
  - Consider turbotax as a product, not specific platforms
  - These are geared to get you thinkin about what the problem areas are

## Use case 1 How do we introduce a new asset?
  - Guidelines written out to what types we use; and theyre consistent across all platforms
  - RCA process; priorities
  - Design driving a new experience -> then adding a new asset 
  - RCA - Look at the assets we currently have and see if we already have something similar.
  - When we get requests for new assets; developers arent looped in at the appropriate stages.

## use case 2: How do we deprecate an asset? ... but in an ideal scenario
  - We dont. 
  - We can pin TTO to prior tax year.
  - Major release every tax year.
  - The easy thing is to talk about the legacy stuff that is now built into player core. A lot of plugins that just check if string is true. We can deprecate these plugins and implement better ones.
  - Remove a lot of the bloat.
  - Removing assets is a harder thing to deprecate. Some assets just dont get used, but we can deprecate pieces of the API for it. Some arent designed for the semantic way. 
  - [Is there a strategy for removing an asset API?]
  - Remove the docs or have something saying that says its deprecated and use x instead.

## Use case 3: how do we introduce a new external action?
- Adding it into a map of our external actions
- Bigger issue; how do we get it onto mobile and native
- Is there a quantity of usage in order to introduce one?
- "backdoor to app integration"
- Idea that there are more external actions

## Any other use cases you can think of?
- View type assets - all are the same but they have different names.
  - suppose to be design intent 
- Similar properties on all the views
- Maps to a singular component the same way.
- Needs to be some reconcilliation for assets that have overlap.
- We switch out patterns; i.e. tax hub replaces landing tables. [ how do we do this? what pain points do we have]
  - do we a design for mobile? 
  - how do you introduce a component that has functionality that may or may not be differnt somewhere else in the stack. What kinda transforms exist
  - a potential solution would be to load it into a different slice of player. 
  - we can change the DSL representation of an asset to change the ui without changing the content
  - how do we solve for legacy assets that dont have DSL?
- hard to get the confidence to know that someone isnt using the old asset.
- Too many changes came in at once for landing tables; hard to compare. 

## What is the turbotax player integration? and who owns it?
  - Need to define a player integration?
    - assets, expressions, types
    - external actions, beacon handling, flow manager

  - How do the content authors know what features are supported?
    - storybook, plugin documentation
    - validator can be used
    - code
  
  - What parts of Turbotax player integration do you own?
    - What do you WANT to own
  

# Going Forward
- Needs 
  - Account for ALL Platforms (even appletv)
  - Explicilty define set of Player capabilities
    - For integrators, content authors, plugin authors
    - versioning
  - Need to be clear what parts can be reused 
  - Process for introducing new capabilities 
    -removing old

# Outcome
  - need to define what the TurboTax Player integration encapsulates and how to govern it.

  - What role does the cgds team play here
    - where are the gaps that we need others to fill
  

# Q&A
-Something that creates more gaps
  - our team is 3 platforms
  - if a team wants a new external action; almost hard to figure out who wants it, and if that team knows the platforms thats required to make it happen
  - May make sense to define the platforms up front in the proposal but also be open to having it scale.
